# Contribution Guidelines

When contributing, please ...
- provide a clear and concise explanation of your pull request.
- try to make small changes, ie, make many small pull requests as opposed to a single large pull request. This allows me to check your work more quickly, thus merge more quickly.
- try to follow the patterns I've already established.

Thank you.
