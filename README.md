# My SV06 Klipper Config 
## This was pulled from a working printer
### here are the details of the machine  
This is the whole Config from my Sovol SV06, it is based on the work by Bassamanator from this Git https://github.com/bassamanator/Sovol-SV06-firmware  
My printer runs a timing belt below the print bed frame to keep both z axis  stepper sin sync 
see this https://www.printables.com/model/766592-pulley-cover-for-sovol-sv06-with-z-axis-belt
and this https://youtu.be/GM3FqE5_D54   


It is klipperized with a cheap Inovato Quadra SBC
is equipped with a Logitec C90 webcam 
and has few other mods including this https://www.printables.com/model/433884-sovol-sv06-x-twist-fix-top-bar-upgrade
